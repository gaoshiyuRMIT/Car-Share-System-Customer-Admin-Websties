follow steps outlined here:

https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/guides/service/python/embed/audio?hardware=rpi

important notes:
- device /card numbers can reset or change when devices are unplugged or on boot
- something ?? was saving over my .asoundrc file (seemingly when i ran the google assistant demo files) so watch out for that
